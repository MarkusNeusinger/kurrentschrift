"""Changelog fragments: one file per PR under `changelog.d/`, folded into
`CHANGELOG.md` when a release is cut.

Why fragments. Every PR used to add its bullets under `[Unreleased]` of the one
shared file, so every sibling merge conflicted the others exactly there (the
website-audit series of 2026-08-29/30: five PRs, a hand-resolved rebase after
each merge). A union merge driver (`.gitattributes`) heals the LOCAL rebase for
pure additions, but GitHub's own mergeability check ignores merge drivers, and
a branch that MOVES changelog lines comes out of a union rebase with the block
duplicated. Fragments remove the shared spot altogether: a PR adds
`changelog.d/<slug>.md` and touches nothing else; the release cut folds every
fragment — plus whatever `[Unreleased]` still holds from before the fragments
existed — under the new version heading, bumps the version files and deletes
the fragments.

A fragment is a slice of the CHANGELOG in the CHANGELOG's own format —
`### <Category>` headings over bold-titled bullets — so the assembled section
reads exactly as if it had been written there, and ONE parser serves the
fragments and the `[Unreleased]` section alike. Standard library only, so the
CI gate runs it without the project's extras.

Three verbs (`python -m tools.changelog …`, see `__main__`):

* `check [--base REF]` — every fragment parses and carries no unfilled `(#NNN)`
  placeholder; with `--base`, the diff against REF must carry a fragment (or be
  a release cut, or data-only) and must not ADD bullets to `[Unreleased]`
  directly (correcting one that is already there is fine — a bullet is
  identified by its bold title, not by its full text).
* `preview` — the merged `[Unreleased]` as the next cut would write it.
* `release VERSION --title …` — the cut itself.
