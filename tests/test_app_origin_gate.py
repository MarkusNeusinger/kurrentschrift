"""The SITE container's origin gate, held against the six files it is spread over.

`api/origin_gate.py` closes the API service's door and says, in as many words,
that the app service has a second one: its nginx relays a crawler user agent to
`https://api.kurrentschrift.ink`, where the edge stamps the API's secret
legitimately — so a caller on the raw `*.run.app` URL reaches the prerendered
page, and the crawler Plausible event the API reports for it, without having
passed the edge himself. This is that door; `tests/test_api_origin_gate.py` next
door is the other half of the same mechanism.

The reason it needs a test at all is that no single file contains it:

1. **`app/origin-gate.conf.template`** decides, and is the only place the secret
   is written. It is a TEMPLATE because nginx cannot read the environment; the
   base image's entrypoint renders it before nginx starts.
2. **`app/nginx.conf`** enforces, and must never so much as name the header — a
   `log_format`, an `add_header` or a `return` that did would publish the secret
   the gate exists to keep.
3. **`app/Dockerfile`** is what makes the rendering happen, and carries the two
   defaults without which the container does not boot at all.
4. **`app/cloudbuild.yaml`** and **`.github/workflows/bot-serving-check.yml`**
   are the two legitimate callers that reach this origin WITHOUT the edge, by
   design, and would each be 403'd into silence.
5. **`infra/cloudflare/kurrentschrift-api-proxy.js`** is the one Worker in the
   repo, and the reason it needs no stamping for this gate is a property of its
   code — it forwards every path to the API host — not a standing fact.

None of the five can see the other four, and every one of them fails silently:
the site keeps serving, the deploy keeps going green, and what breaks is a
crawler path that nobody watches by eye.

What this file cannot see is whether the rendered config actually boots — the
`app-image` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the real image with the gate
off, armed, and armed with no secret, which is the half a text test can never do.
