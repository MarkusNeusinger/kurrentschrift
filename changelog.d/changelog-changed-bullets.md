### Fixed

- **Correcting a bullet in `[Unreleased]` no longer reads as adding one.**
  The fragment gate compared bullet SETS, so re-wording an entry the base
  already carried was indistinguishable from writing a new one and got the
  same refusal — "gained a bullet, it belongs in a fragment" — for a change
  that added nothing. A bullet is now identified by its bold title
  (`tools/changelog`, `bullet_title`), collapsed over the line breaks so a
  correction may reflow the very line the title runs over, and counted rather
  than set-differenced so a second copy of a title cannot slip in behind the
  first: a title the base lacks is an ADDED bullet and is still refused, a
  title it has is a CHANGED one and passes. The same title makes the
  unterminated `- **…`
  detectable at all, so the check the sibling repo already had comes along.

### Added

- **`check` refuses a fragment that still says `(#NNN)`.** The PR reference
  stays optional — a fragment without one is the normal case — but the
  placeholder shipped as written reads as a reference in the released
  section and points nowhere, and nothing caught it. The complaint names the
  file and the line; a placeholder quoted in backticks is prose about the
  rule, not a reference, and passes.
